# nand2tetris - Tamir Sida

This repository contains my implementation of the **nand2tetris** course projects, where we build a computer from the ground up using simple logic gates.

## Overview

The **nand2tetris** course teaches the fundamentals of computer science by constructing a computer from the most basic logic gate: NAND. The course involves designing hardware, building a CPU, and developing an assembler, virtual machine, and even a simple operating system.

This repository includes solutions to various projects from the course, implemented in HDL (Hardware Description Language), and accompanying software components.
